# About the project

A simple project while iÂ´m studying k means clustering technique with the mall customers dataset from kaggle (a toy dataset). 

About the Dataset: This input file contains the basic information (ID, age, gender, income, spending score) about the customers of a mall. Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

Project Structure: 
 - It is structured on 2 folders:
    1. 01-datasets: where all the datasets used are. 
    2. 02-notebooks: where all the notebooks for the analysis are.
         - Exploratory Data Analysis in order to identify patters and relationships previous the model. 
         - K Means Clustering technique validating assumptions with the elbow & silhouette score method.
